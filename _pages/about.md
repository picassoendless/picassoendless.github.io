Tendai Nemure is a cybersecurity researcher based in New York, currently completing an M.S. in Cybersecurity (GPA 4.0) at Yeshiva University’s Katz School of Science and Health. Tendai’s background combines deep learning, security analytics, and applied cryptography, with prior training in Information Technology from Bindura University of Science Education in Zimbabwe.

Tendai’s research focuses on **AI for cybersecurity**, responsible and explainable AI, zero trust architectures, federated learning, digital identity and trust in remote care, deepfake resistance, and privacy-preserving authentication for telehealth systems. Additional interests include human–AI interaction for safety-critical systems and multi-agent systems for cyber defense, with a strong emphasis on security analytics for large-scale, cloud-native environments.

Recent work includes co‑authoring peer‑reviewed articles on crowdsourced cyber resilience and the “human firewall,” exploring community-based threat intelligence, storytelling, and collective awareness as foundations for modern cyber defense. Tendai also has experience in medical imaging and deep learning, including EfficientNet-based diabetic retinopathy classification using retinal fundus images, bridging healthcare and security perspectives in data-sensitive domains.

This website highlights ongoing and past work across publications, research projects, talks, and prospective PhD directions in cybersecurity and AI. It also serves as a hub for sharing ideas on building secure, privacy-aware, and trustworthy intelligent systems.
