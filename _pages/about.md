# About

**Tendai Nemure** is a cybersecurity researcher and AI practitioner based in New York, currently completing an M.S. in Cybersecurity at Yeshiva University's Katz School of Science and Health. With a background in Information Technology from Bindura University of Science Education in Zimbabwe, Tendai brings a multidisciplinary perspective spanning artificial intelligence, security analytics, and applied cryptography.

## Research Interests

Tendai's research focuses on **AI for cybersecurity**, exploring the intersection of machine learning, security engineering, and privacy-preserving systems. Key areas of interest include:

- Responsible and explainable AI (XAI) for security applications
- Zero trust architectures and federated learning
- Digital identity and trust in remote healthcare systems
- Deepfake resistance and privacy-preserving authentication
- Human–AI interaction for safety-critical systems
- Multi-agent systems for cyber defense

His work emphasizes building secure, trustworthy intelligent systems that balance innovation with privacy, transparency, and real-world impact.

Current research includes *Silent by Design: Reasoning Vulnerabilities in Medical Chain-of-Thought Systems*, investigating security and interpretability challenges in AI-driven clinical decision support.

Tendai is pursuing advanced research opportunities at the intersection of AI, cybersecurity, and healthcare technology. His goal is to develop intelligent systems that are not only powerful and efficient, but also secure, privacy-aware, and aligned with human values—particularly in safety-critical and data-sensitive domains.
